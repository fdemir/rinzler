# Rinzler
Rinzler is an example implementation of microservice frontend architecture via using single-spa framework. The aim is release a project is similar to spotify. Each individual app uses different tech stack to expose the component. 

There is no attempt to produce a production ready project. It's just a experimental project and see how it works. But anyway we have still some issues about implementing the mfa.

*Micro-frontend architecture is a strategy in which the traditionally monolithic frontend codebase is split into smaller apps, ideally addressing the various business domains. All these smaller elements form a seamless frontend interface that delivers top-notch user experience and is easy to modify and scale.*

## General Info

there are three kinds of microfrontends in single-spa framework. The list is following:
1. single-spa applications: Microfrontends that render components for a set of specific routes.
2. single-spa parcels: Microfrontends that render components without controlling routes.
3. utility modules: Microfrontends that export shared JavaScript logic without rendering components.

root-config(single-spa) 5000

Microfrontends:
- sidebar(react) 5001
- main(svelte) 5002
- friends list(vue) 5003
- player(svelte) 5004
